# PowerContext Go

PowerContext Go requires Go 1.27.0 or newer. Its current alignment target is
the formal PowerContext v0.1.0 release at
`7b736206a53a6de6f43d4b517893ee1a80e7183d`; the frozen Python v0.0.2
snapshot remains a historical regression fixture, not the current acceptance
target. The implementation uses Go-native domain types, lifecycle ownership,
concurrency, persistence, transports, and release packaging.

```text
module github.com/ob-labs/powercontext-go
parity target powercontext-v0.1.0 7b736206a53a6de6f43d4b517893ee1a80e7183d
historical fixture python-v0.0.2 3a6cb0151670eaff7dc0293466edd673124e80da
```

The HTTP source of truth is [`openapi/powercontext.yaml`](openapi/powercontext.yaml).
Generated code under `api/v1` and generated operation tables are never edited
by hand. Compatibility evidence lives under `test/conformance`: the v0.1.0
release inventory contains 812 Python test cases in 132 files, alongside the
immutable historical v0.0.2 fixture.

## Repository shape

- `source`, `artifact`, `trigger`, and `inference` are lifecycle-free public
  extension contracts; `artifact/{memory,experience,skill,handoff}` contains
  the public typed Artifact families.
- `internal/{review,contextpack,handoffreport,stats,work}` contains product
  domains that are shared by the Server but are not part of the embedded Go
  SDK surface.
- `internal/runtime` owns admission, Scope boundaries, same-Scope write
  serialization, scheduled processing, and application use cases.
- `client` and `server` are public remote and process facades.
- `internal` contains product-only domains and concrete adapters: SQL,
  providers, scheduler, endpoints, HTTP, MCP, dashboard, CLI, and
  observability. Native seekDB and sqlite-vec ownership lives below
  `internal/sqlstore`.

- `integrations` contains maintained host-native adapters. They communicate
  only with the Go Server and are auxiliary monorepo assets rather than Go
  binary implementation languages. Before WP6 acceptance, the primary host
  scope is Codex and WorkBuddy only; all other retained hosts are P3 work.
- `evaluation` contains the deployment-neutral Codex/SQLite evaluation control
  plane. It is maintained and tested in this repository, but is neither
  embedded in the Go binary nor a Go release-runtime requirement.
- `test` contains conformance, differential, and process-level suites; `tools`
  contains generators and release tooling.
- `benchmark/locomo` contains operator-facing LoCoMo configuration and result
  space; its Go runner lives in `tools/locomo`, with deterministic internals in
  `internal/benchmark/locomo`.

The deliberate public Go packages are checked against the approved pre-release
baseline under `test/api-compat`. `make api-compat` permits compatible additions
but rejects removed or incompatibly changed exported identifiers. Updating the
baseline with `make api-baseline` requires review of the compatibility impact;
the baseline is a pre-release change-control gate, not a declaration of Go v1
stability before the first release.

There is intentionally no `common`, `utils`, generic repository layer, or DI
container. Shared infrastructure exists only where it has one clear owner—for
example, privacy-safe `log/slog` setup under `internal/observability/logging`.

This is a Go-primary monorepo: Python and TypeScript host assets and the
evaluation control plane remain tracked, licensed, and tested, but GitHub
language statistics deliberately exclude them from the primary Go product
classification. The pre-WP6 acceptance matrix is Codex, WorkBuddy, and
SQLite. Retained host adapters expand after WP6; seekDB and OceanBase remain
the final backend-alignment scope.

## Build and verify

The standard build uses CGO and statically embeds the same sqlite-vec 0.1.9
`vec0` implementation as the Python runtime:

```sh
make check
make lint
make contract-test
make unit-test
make e2e-test
make build
```

Run the server with the frozen defaults:

```sh
./bin/powercontext server run
```

Server configuration uses `POWERCONTEXT_SERVER_*`; remote CLI configuration
uses `POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_SERVER_URL`, `POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_API_TOKEN`, and
`POWERCONTEXT_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`. The full local-embedding build additionally
requires the native tokenizer and ONNX Runtime assets described in
[`docs/release/INSTALL.md`](docs/release/INSTALL.md).

Run `powercontext config init --non-interactive` to create a managed local
environment file. Inspect it without disclosing credential values with
`powercontext config show --env-file .env`, and validate syntax, persistent
storage paths, and Server settings with `powercontext config validate --env-file .env`.
The same installation guide documents the optional native seekDB profile;
SQLite remains the zero-dependency default.

Plain HTTP is trusted only on loopback (`localhost`, `::1`, or any address in
`127.0.0.0/8`). The Server refuses an unauthenticated non-loopback bind by
default. For remote access, enable bearer authentication and terminate TLS in
front of the Server; controlled networks or deployments with upstream TLS may
instead opt in explicitly with
`POWERCONTEXT_SERVER_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_NON_LOOPBACK=true`.

For an authenticated non-loopback bind behind a TLS terminator, replace the
example token before starting the Server:

```sh
POWERCONTEXT_SERVER_AUTH_ENABLED=true \
POWERCONTEXT_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN='replace-with-a-strong-token' \
./bin/powercontext server run --host 0.0.0.0
```

The Go Client likewise rejects plaintext HTTP to a non-loopback Server unless
the caller supplies its own `http.Client` and explicitly sets
`TrustTransportSecurity` for a separately secured transport.

Useful verification targets:

```sh
make lint-fix
make license-check
make pi-test
make docs-test
make test-race
make test-full TOKENIZERS_LIB_DIR=/path/to/tokenizers/lib
POWERCONTEXT_TEST_OCEANBASE_URL='mysql+aoceanbase://root%40tenant:password@127.0.0.1:2881/powercontext?charset=utf8mb4' \
  make test-oceanbase-live
```

The lint targets install the pinned `golangci-lint` release under
`.tools/bin`; its embedded gofumpt and goimports versions are therefore the same
locally and in CI. No mutable global linter installation is used.

If a newly added source file is missing the standard Apache-2.0 header, repair
all eligible files and immediately recheck them with one command:

```sh
make license-fix
```

The checked file types and deliberate generated/vendor exclusions are defined
in [`.licenserc.yaml`](.licenserc.yaml). SkyWalking Eyes is version-pinned by
the Make target and does not modify prompt text, fixtures, lock files, or
generated Go contracts.

The OceanBase target requires a dedicated disposable MySQL-mode database. It
verifies tenant and charset negotiation, the complete core and optional Report
schemas, Source cursor CAS, and Handoff Report Activity allocation against the
real server rather than a SQL mock.

The Go-native LoCoMo benchmark uses the same runtime, database, providers, and
frozen dataset contract as Python:

```sh
go run ./tools/locomo inspect --env-file benchmark/locomo/.env.example
go run ./tools/locomo run --env-file .env --run-id locomo-smoke \
  --conversation-limit 1 --question-limit 5
```

See [`benchmark/locomo/README.md`](benchmark/locomo/README.md) for resumable
ingestion, reranking, Source expansion, and independent rejudging.

formats, lifecycle ownership, or generated contracts.
